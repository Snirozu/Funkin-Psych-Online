Value 1: Value,Mode
Value 2: Duration,Ease 
If Mode is "stage", Value will be multiplied by the
stage's default zoom, else the zoom will be equal
to Value. This can be skipped.
Duration works in Steps.
Ease can be skipped as the default one is "linear".
Leave Value 2 blank if you want the zoom to be instant.
